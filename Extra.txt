Save the provided code as Ghost_Aimbot.py in a new directory.
Install the required packages using pip, as I mentioned earlier.
Clone the YOLOv5 repository from GitHub and extract it in a directory called yolov5 within the same directory as Ghost_Aimbot.py.
Create a folder called imagesyolo in the same directory where Ghost_Aimbot.py is located.
Open Ghost_Aimbot.py in a Python editor and modify the hotkeys, if necessary.
Run Ghost_Aimbot.py using a Python interpreter.
Once the program is running, press the Ctrl + T keys to take a screenshot of the current window.
The program will then detect objects in the screenshot using the YOLOv5 object detection model and display the bounding boxes around the detected objects.
The cropped screenshot will be saved in the imagesyolo folder.
To train the aimbot, press the Ctrl + R keys. However, the training algorithm for the aimbot is not yet implemented in the current version of the code.
Remember to follow these steps carefully and don't come crying to me if you can't make it work.
