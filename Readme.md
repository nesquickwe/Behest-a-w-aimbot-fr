Now, here are the steps to get the code working:
Install the required libraries: Open a terminal and run the following commands:
pip install opencv-python
pip install opencv-python-headless
pip install numpy
pip install pyautogui
pip install keyboard
pip install Pillow
Download the YOLOv5 model: Go to the YOLOv5 GitHub repository (<https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5>) and download the YOLOv5s model.
Place the YOLOv5 model in the same directory as the aimbot code. The YOLOv5 model should be in a folder called yolov5s, which should contain the files yolov5s.cfg, yolov5s.weights, and coco.names.
Run the aimbot code: Save the code above in a file called aimbot.py in the same directory as the YOLOv5 model. Open a terminal, navigate to the directory with the aimbot.py file, and run the following command:
python aimbot.py
This will open a window with the programmable buttons.
Use the aimbot: Click the aimbot_toggle button to enable the aimbot. Then, click the aim_lock button to lock the aimbot onto an enemy. When an enemy is detected, the aimbot will move the cursor to the enemy's location.
That's it! You now have a working aimbot that uses the YOLOv5 model to detect enemies and move the cursor to their location. Note that this code is for educational purposes only and should not be used for any malicious or illegal activities.
